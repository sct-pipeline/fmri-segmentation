# fmri-segmentation
Repository for the project on automatic spinal cord segmentation based on fMRI EPI data

<details open>
<summary>To share data for the project, please expand this text!</summary>
<br>

## Aim
To develop a method to automate the time-consuming segmentation
of the spinal cord for fMRI and then make the method openly available to the spinal cord fMRI community. The model will be incorporated into the [Spinal Cord Toolbox](https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/). The data will be used only for the purpose of segmenting the spinal cord. Co-authorship on any abstracts or publications will be offered to anyone who contributes data to the project.

## What to share?
GitHub repository that contains the example data: https://github.com/sct-pipeline/fmri-segmentation/tree/main/data_leipzig_rest

To facilitate the collection, sharing and processing of data, we use the [BIDS standard](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). An example of the data structure for one center is shown below:

      "Description": "A two-step motion correction procedure (with spline interpolation) was applied to the EPI time-series data. Initially, the mean of all volumes (250 volumes) was calculated in order to serve as the target image for the first step of motion correction. Based on this mean image, the spinal cord was automatically segmented in order to provide a spinal cord centerline that then served as input for creating a cylindrical mask (with a diameter of 30 mm). This mask was employed during the motion-correction procedure in order to ensure that regions moving independently from the cord would not adversely affect motion estimation. Slice-wise motion correction with a second degree polynomial regularization in the z-direction was then performed. In the second step, a new target image was obtained by calculating the mean of motion-corrected images from the first step and the raw images were realigned to this new target image, using the identical procedure as described above.",

### C. fMRI data
Please share **one run** of each participant within one **session** and do **not** share data from same participants within each study. <br />
Please only share *.nii.gz* files and **not** *.nii* files.

Task information: See the **task-xx_bold.json**. Include a brief description of the functional task.
1. 	20 motion-corrected EPI volumes <br />
Naming: **sub-XX_task-XX_desc-moco_bold.nii.gz**
2. Sidecar .json file containing information about the acquisition (can be obtained using [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix))
Naming: **sub-XX_task-XX_desc-moco_bold.json**
3. 	Mean of motion-corrected volumes (please share the mean image that was used to draw the spinal cord mask) <br />
Naming: **sub-XX_task-XX_desc-mocomean_bold.nii.gz**
4. 	Spinal cord masks that were generated based on mean of motion-corrected volumes. Note: Only include the slices that were used in the subject-level analysis. <br />
Naming: **sub-XX_task-XX_desc-spinalcord_mask.nii.gz**

> **Volume**: an individual data acquisition point. <br />
> **Run**: multiple volumes acquired as one continuous stream of data. <br />
> **Session**: a set of multiple runs during which subjects remained inside the bore of the magnet.

#### How to name your participants?
Name the dataset folder like following:
data_**NameoftheSite**_**NameoftheTask** ---> for example: data_leipzig_rest, data_leipzig_pain, data_northwestern_pain, data_stanford_motor

Name the subjects like following: sub-**NameorAcronymfortheSiteSubjectNumber**
>  data_leipzig_rest/
  >> sub-leipzigR01 <br />
  >> sub-leipzigR02 <br />
  ...

If you are sharing multiple datasets from different studies:
- Have a separate folder for each different study such as: data_northwestern_pain, data_northwestern_motor
- Within these folders, give unique names to each participant such as

>  data_northwestern_motor/
  >> sub-nwM01 <br />
  >> sub-nwM02

> data_northwestern_pain/
>> sub-nwP01 <br />
>> sub-nwP02 <br />
>> .... <br />
sub-nwP10


## How to share?
